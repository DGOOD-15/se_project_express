# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

In this project i used Express.js and mongoDB to build and work with the backend of the WTWR website. You can now create, update, and delete users and clothing items using the back end databases. i used schemas to set the structure of the data for noth the user and clothing items. The controllers check for valid data and ensure the application runs smooth. I also use routes to facilitate efficient navigation within the web application

## Technologies used

Express.js
MongoDB
Postman
ESLint
CORS

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
